# Data Gaps and Research Priorities

The following research priorities were identified based on
previous CIE reviews and recent Plan Team and SSC discussions:

- Explore priors on catchability and the effect on the population
  scale and potentially how it relates to results from the
  predation mortality model.
- Estimate input variances for weight at age components in the
  WAA RE model.
- Continue to develop spatial GLMM models for survey indices and
  age composition of GOA pollock
- Evaluate pollock population dynamics in a multi-species context
  using the CEATTLE model.
- Explore implications of non-constant natural mortality on
  pollock assessment and management.
- Extend the maximum age to better account for dynamics for older fish, particularly in light of the large 2012 cohort.

Additional recommendations that could be done by other teams at
the AFSC, but are unlikely to be specifically prioritized by the
primary assessment author, include:

- Efforts to combine acoustic and bottom trawl information in a
  vertically integrated index, or similar approaches to better understand
  how gear availability varies over time and space [@monnahan2021b].
- Efforts to improve understanding of changes of weight at age or
  and maturity at age, either via linkage to copepods/euphausiids
  or directly to the physical environment
- Efforts to better understand drivers of recruitment variability

# Acknowledgements
We thank the AFSC survey personnel for the collection of data,
providing the biomass estimates, and discussing results. We are
grateful to all the fishery observers working with the Fishery
Monitoring and Analysis (FMA) Division who collect vital data for
the stock assessments, and the staff of the AFSC Age and Growth
Program for the ageing of otoliths used to determine the age
compositions in the assessment. We also thank Kally Spalinger for
providing ADF&G survey data and Dave McGowan for providing summer
acoustic data this year.
