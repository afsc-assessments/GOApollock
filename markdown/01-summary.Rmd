# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

### Changes to input data
1. Fishery: 2020 total catch and catch at age.
2. Shelikof Strait acoustic survey: 2021 biomass index and age composition.
3. NMFS bottom trawl survey: 2021 biomass index and length composition
4. Summer acoustic survey: 2021 biomass index and length composition
5. ADF&G crab/groundfish trawl survey: 2021 biomass index and 2020 age composition

### Changes in assessment methodology
The age-structured assessment model is identical to the model used for the 2019 and 2020 assessments (Model 19.1). 

## Summary of Results

The base model projection of female spawning biomass in 2022 is 186,481 t, which is 43.4% of unfished spawning biomass (based on average post-1977 recruitment) and above B40% (172,000 t), thereby placing GOA pollock in sub-tier “a” of Tier 3. New surveys in 2021 include the winter Shelikof Strait acoustic survey, NMFS bottom trawl survey, summer acoustic survey, and ADF&G bottom trawl survey. These surveys indicated similar relative abundance in 2021, unlike previous years when the surveys showed strongly contrasting trends. The risk matrix table recommended by the SSC was used to determine whether to recommend an ABC lower than the maximum permissible. The table is applied by evaluating the severity of four types of considerations that could be used to support a scientific recommendation to reduce the ABC from the maximum permissible. Although we identified some aspects of the stock that merit close tracking, there were no elevated concerns about stock assessment, population dynamics, environment/ecosystem, or fisheries performance categories. We therefore recommend no reduction from maximum permissible ABC.

The authors’ 2022 ABC recommendation for pollock in the Gulf of Alaska west of 140° W lon. (W/C/WYK regions) is 133,081 t, which is an increase of 26% from the 2021 ABC. The author’s recommended 2023 ABC is 131,912 t. The OFL in 2022 is 154,983 t, and the OFL in 2023 if the ABC is taken in 2022 is 153,097 t. These calculations are based on a projected 2021 catch of 92,342 t (Mary Furuness, pers. comm. Oct. 14, 2021). It should be noted that the ABC is projected to increase after 2023 even as the large 2012 year class continues to diminish due to new large cohorts entering the exploitable stock, although there is considerable uncertainty about the 2018 year class.

For pollock in southeast Alaska (Southeast Outside region, east of 140° W lon.), the ABC recommendation for both 2022 and 2023 is 11,363 t (see Appendix 1B) and the OFL recommendation for both 2022 and 2023 is 15,150 t. These recommendations are based on a Tier 5 assessment using the projected biomass in 2022 and 2023 from a random effects model fit to the 1990-2021 bottom trawl survey biomass estimates of the assessment area.
