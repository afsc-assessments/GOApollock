In the future, we plan to conduct a thorough evaluation of the
information provided in the Economic SAFE and ACEPO report to
determine what socioeconomic indicators could be provided in the
ESP that are not redundant with those reports and related
directly to stock health. This may result in a transition of
indicators currently reported in this ESP to a different series
of socioeconomic indicators in future ESPs and may include
aggregating small communities as suggested or focusing more on
dependency rather than engagement. Additional considerations
should be given for the timing of the economic and community
reports that are delayed by 1-2 years depending on the data
source from the annual stock assessment cycle and how this
information might inform the stock assessment

We did not explore alternative functional forms in this
assessment. We noticed that the initial inflection point of the
double-logistic selectivity curve was about age 4, and
hypothesized that if the time variation in this component were
too small (too little annual flexibility) it could cause the
aforementioned residual pattern. Thus, as a first step, we tried
allowing for greater flexibility in both the time-varying initial
inflection and slope used to control the selectivity of younger
fish by increasing the process error on the random walk
components. Despite this increased flexibility, we found no
appreciable improvement to the age-4 residuals. We therefore
agree that investigation of alternative functional forms is
warranted, and will explore that in future assessments.

The model uses a random walk on log scale to estimate a
time-varying catchability for the Shelikof biomass index. It is
possible for the estimated catchability to be greater
than 1. While this has not occurred to date, we note that the
confidence intervals exceeded it in recent years. We therefore
tried an alternative form by estimating the random walk in
inverse logit (i.e., logistic) space, so that the estimated
catchability and its uncertainty was naturally constrained
between 0 and 1. Due to the change in parameterization, the
assumed process error for the random walk needed to be increased
to allow for a similar level of flexibility. The following figure
shows the results of catchability, fit to the index, and
estimated spawning biomass for the original and logistic
versions, with the latter having more flexibility allowed.

The logistic transformation works to constrain the catchability
to its assumed natural range, but results in a shift in absolute
size of the stock for unclear reasons. The specification of the
magnitude of the process error also needs further
investigation. So despite its promise, we did not bring forward
this as an alternative this year. Further investigations will be
done for next year, with tentative plans to explore estimating
the process error in a state-space approach.

Results comparing the original log and new logistic
transformation for the random-walk catchability of the Shelikof
index. Estimated catchability (top) with 95% confidence intervals

indices (lines) are shown with the observed data (points and
vertical lines; middle panel). Estimated spawning biomass with
95% confidence interval (ribbons) is shown at bottom.

Such an analysis would be extremely informative and valuable to
improving this assessment. One of the most challenging tasks is
reprocessing the acoustic data. We have initiated conversations
with both the acoustic and bottom trawl survey groups about what
it would take to have suitable data for this analysis. We will
continue to work with them on the feasibility of this. However,
we agree with previous authorsâ€™ argument that this should be
considered a long-term research objective.

We performed this incremental leave-one-out experiment for the
four surveys, but included the weight and length compositions in
addition to the indices. Results are shown in the following
figure where the model is fitted without each survey in turn. The
trends are generally the same. The summer acoustic has little
effect, due to only having four years of data. The ADF&G and
Shelikof surveys have a relative minor impact if dropped, except
in recent years with the notable divergence in index trends. Most
noteworthy is that the NMFS bottom trawl survey sets the scale of
the population (without it there is a notable increase in
uncertainty and an absolute increase in estimates), which is tied
to its catchability which is not well-estimated and instead is
driven by an informative prior. This analysis suggests revisiting
the formation of that prior and how it interacts with the scale
of the population.
