## Reference fishing mortality rates and spawning biomass levels

Since 1997, GOA pollock have been managed under Tier 3 of the
NPFMC tier system.  In Tier 3, reference mortality rates are
based on spawning biomass per recruit (SPR), while biomass
reference levels are estimated by multiplying the SPR by average
recruitment.  Estimates of the FSPR harvest rates were obtained
using the life history characteristics of GOA pollock (Table
1.\@ref(tab:spr-inputs)). Spawning biomass reference levels were
based on mean 1978-`r year-1` age-1 recruitment 
(`r avgrec` billion), which is `r pct.avgrec.change`% higher than the mean
value in last year's assessment. Spawning was assumed to occur on
March 15th, and a long-term average of maturity at age (1983- 
`r year`) was used with mean spawning weight at age from the
Shelikof Strait acoustic surveys in `r year-4`-`r year` to
estimate current reproductive potential.  Fishery weight at age
was assumed to be the most recent estimate from the RE model.
Pollock weight-at-age is highly variable, showing a sustained
increase, followed by a steep decline until a sharp increase from
2020 to `r year` (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:fig-waa-srv1)). The factors
causing this pattern are unclear, but are likely to involve both
density-dependent factors and environmental forcing. The SPR at
F=0 was estimated as `r round(spr0,3)` kg/recruit at age one.
FSPR rates depend on the selectivity pattern of the fishery.
Selectivity has changed as the fishery evolved from a foreign
fishery occurring along the shelf break to a domestic fishery on
spawning aggregations and in nearshore waters.  For SPR
calculations, selectivity was based on the average for `r year -4` 
- `r year-1` to reflect current selectivity patterns. GOA
pollock FSPR harvest rates are given below:

```{r}
tab <- read_xlsx(table.path, sheet='SPR')
tab[,1] <- paste0(  format(round(100*dplyr::pull(tab,1),1), nsmall=1),"%")
tab[,7] <- paste0(  format(round(100*dplyr::pull(tab,7),1), nsmall=1),"%")
flextable(tab) %>%
  colformat_double(digits=0, big.mark=',')  %>%
  colformat_double(digits=3, j=2)
```
<!-- The B40% estimate of `r b40` t represents a  -->
<!-- `r pct.b40.changeF`from the  B40% estimate of `r b40.last` t in the -->
<!-- `r year-1` assessment (Table 1.\@ref(tab:model-history)). The base model -->
<!-- projection of female spawning biomass in `r year+1` is  -->
<!-- `r ssb` t, which is `r pct.status` of unfished spawning biomass (based on -->
<!-- average post-1977 recruitment) and above B40% (`r b40` t), -->
<!-- thereby placing GOA pollock in sub-tier "a" of Tier 3.  -->

## `r year+1` acceptable biological catch (ABC)

The definitions of OFL and maximum permissible FABC under
Amendment 56 provide a buffer between the overfishing level and
the intended harvest rate, as required by NMFS national standard
guidelines.  Since estimates of stock biomass from assessment
models are uncertain, the buffer between OFL and ABC provides a
margin of safety so that assessment error will not result in the
OFL being inadvertently exceeded. For GOA pollock, the maximum
permissible FABC harvest rate (i.e., FABC/FOFL) is 
`r format(100*fabc/fofl, digits=3)`% of the OFL harvest rate.
Projections for `r year+1` for the FOFL and the maximum
permissible FABC are given in Table 1.\@ref(tab:proj-scens).
