## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment
Detailed analyses to SSC and Plan Team comments were presented at
the September PT meeting, including a publically available
document to which the interested reader is referred

Summaries of responses are provided here. 

In December 2021 the SSC noted "... *that recruitment deviations
in the GOA pollock assessment are unconstrained except for the
terminal two years, and suggests that exploring a moderate
constraint on recruitment deviations in all years, as is commonly
applied in other assessments, may be warranted. At a minimum,
this would allow an assessment of the sensitivity of results to
only constraining the last two years."*

Previous model versions applied a penalty of $\sigma_R=1$ to the
first eight and last two cohorts, with all other deviations being
freely estimated. Historically this setup had no estimation
issues, but there are some advantages to a consistent approach
and so this approach was adopted. A value of $\sigma_R=1.3$ was
adopted, based on an estimate from a state-space version of the
assessment, and applied to all deviates.


*The GOA Plan Team in its November 2019 minutes recommended the
author examine fishery selectivity, as persistent patterns in the
catch-at-age residuals may represent artifacts of the selectivity
functional form used.*

Analyses performed in 2021 were extended to include an offset for
age-4 fish, which did improve the fits to the data but had
minimal impact on the assessment outputs. This showed that the
persistent residuals were not adversely affecting management
estimates, and that it is unlikely any parametric form would
alleviate this issue. Consequently, no changes were made to this
years model, but future analyses using non-parametric selectivity
would be warranted.

Persistent patterns in Pearson residuals for older fish were also
deemed not a concern at the moment. This is because a new way of
calculating residuals using a "one step ahead" approach to
account for correlations in the multinomial distribution
[@trijoulet2023], which did not show the same pattern, implying
it was a consequence of the inadequateness of Pearson residuals
and not a real misspecification of selectivity.


In December 2021 the "*SSC suggests simplifying the computations
in the Appendix to reflect the new season structure to the extent
possible, without changing the underlying methodology. For
example, it appears that seasons B1 & B2 (formerly C & D) could
be combined as they use the same apportionment scheme."*

**The apportionment table will be simplified where possible to
reflect the new seasonal structure**. Note that this new
structure was not supposed to change apportionment, and that
motivates the current table which calculates by the previous four
seasons and then sums them together into the new seasons.

*...the SSC encourages the authors and GOA GPT to re-evaluate
whether assessing Southeast Alaska walleye pollock as a separate
stock is justified or whether the available data support a
single, gulf-wide stock assessment. This evaluation may also
benefit from considering recent studies on the genetic structure
of walleye pollock across Alaska and the North Pacific*

Recent genetic studies have not conclusively identified the stock
substructure sufficiently to justify changing to a gulf-wide
assessment.  Samples from the SE GOA were recently taken and
analyses are underway, but the AFSC genetics team needs more time
to complete them (I. Spies pers. comm. Sep '22). This issue will
be revisited once those analyses are completed.
 

In December 2021 the SSC highlighted the need to examine how
catchability for the winter Shelikof acoustic survey.

*The SSC supports future research to identify the optimal level
of constraint on among-year variation in Shelikof Survey
catchability (q), including the potential to estimate the
process error variance internally within the assessment model.*

*The SSC reiterates its recommendation from December 2020 to
explore the use of covariates related to the timing of the survey
to inform survey catchability in the Shelikof Strait survey. For
example, the difference in timing between peak spawning and mean
survey date or, alternatively, the proportion of mature fish in
the survey, are likely to inform time-varying catchability in the
survey.*

Currently the winter Shelikof acoustic survey catchability is
modeled as a random walk with assumed process error. The original
logic was that some of the stock spawned outside of Shelikof
Strait and thus were unavailable to the survey. Fish tended to
spawn in other areas with some consistency, so a random walk on
catchability was implemented to account for variation in spatial
availability. Several overlapping efforts were done to explore
alternative catchability structures. None of these are proposed
for 2022, but were presented for Plan Team feedback in September
2022 and remains ongoing collaborative research for this
stock. In particular a WHAM version of the GOA pollock assessment
was used to explore estimating the constrait (process error), and
to quantify the amount by which timing covariates can reduce
that, in effect parsing spatial and temporal availability.
