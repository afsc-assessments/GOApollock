## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment


*The GOA Plan Team in its November 2019 minutes recommended the
author examine fishery selectivity, as persistent patterns in the
catch-at-age residuals may represent artifacts of the selectivity
functional form used.*

An extensive analysis of non-parametric and parametric fisheries
selectivities was undertaken in 2023 (Appendix 1F). These models showed
promise for improving residual patterns, but had some lingering
estimation and stability issues that need to be more thoroughly
addressed. This will be done next year.


In December 2021 the SSC highlighted the need to examine 
catchability for the winter Shelikof acoustic survey.

*The SSC supports future research to identify the optimal level
of constraint on among-year variation in Shelikof Survey
catchability (q), including the potential to estimate the
process error variance internally within the assessment model.*

*The SSC reiterates its recommendation from December 2020 to
explore the use of covariates related to the timing of the survey
to inform survey catchability in the Shelikof Strait survey. For
example, the difference in timing between peak spawning and mean
survey date or, alternatively, the proportion of mature fish in
the survey, are likely to inform time-varying catchability in the
survey.*

Currently the winter Shelikof acoustic survey catchability is
modeled as a random walk with assumed process error. The original
logic was that some of the stock spawned outside of Shelikof
Strait and thus were unavailable to the survey. Fish tended to
spawn in other areas with some consistency, so a random walk on
catchability was implemented to account for variation in spatial
availability. Several overlapping efforts were done to explore
alternative catchability structures. None of these are proposed
for 2023, but were presented for Plan Team feedback in September
2022 and remains ongoing collaborative research for this
stock. In particular a WHAM version of the GOA pollock assessment
was used to explore estimating the constraint (process error), and
to quantify the amount by which timing covariates can reduce
that, in effect parsing spatial and temporal
availability. Preliminary results are very promising but still
under scientific review and thus not adopted this year. We
anticipate having something formal to present in 2024.

In October 2023 the SSC supported *the GOA GPT recommendation
that additional examinations are necessary to determine best
method(s) for projecting near term trends when time-varying and
auto-correlated selectivities are used in assessments.*

We examined this in Appendix 1F and found that using model
predictions from non-parametric selectivity modules (2D and 3D
AR(1)) generally outperformed the status quo of using an average
of the most recent 4 years with data. The non-parametric
functions led to improved retrospective patterns, but also lower
predictive error (RMSE) in a retrospective analysis when
predicting a single year out and comparing it to estimates with
the data in the subsequent year. Non-parametric modules are not
feasible to fit in a robust way in ADMB models, and so the new
23.0 TMB pollock model provides an important research tool to
explore issues with time-variation and projections. We anticipate
further research along these lines in 2024.
