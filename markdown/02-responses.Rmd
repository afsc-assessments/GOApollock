## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments on Assessments in General

Responses to general issues are also found in the SAFE Introduction.

*When there are time-varying biological and fishery parameters in the model, the SSC requests that a table be included in the SAFE that documents how reference points are calculated.*

This is included in Table 1.\@ref(tab:spr-inputs)



## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment

*Since fishery weight-at-age is so variable, the SSC is interested in seeing if TMB can help use these data directly in the model.*

A WHAM version of the model presented in @correa2023a smooths
weight at age (WAA) internally, but did not find a big impact so this was
not prioritized. However, it is feasible in TMB, and likely
advisable, to model WAA for the fishery and all surveys
simultaneously, with annual, cohort, and age effects. This will
be a priority research topic for 2025.

*Check the recruitment that is set or estimated to be “1” in 2023. If there is no information due to lack of data for young pollock, perhaps recruitment in 2023 should be closer to mean recruitment.*

Previously age 1 recruitments were informed by data from the
Shelikof survey, which has age-1 and 2 indices in the assessment
year. Those data were proposed to be removed from the model in
2024 (model 23c) and so the estimates will be mean recruitment.

*Continue to investigate the estimates of recruitment variability and the extremely low recruitment estimates in recent years.*

The extremely low recruitments were found to be driven entirely
by the age-1 and 2 Shelikof indices which had unreasonably low
estimates. Subsequent data were not able to counteract this
signal and so excessively small cohort estimates persisted. As
such, these data were removed from the model this year until a
more appropriate way to include them can be found.

*The SSC agrees with the GOA GPT to continue to present the 10-year standard used in AFSC assessments for retrospectives as it helps review bodies compare across assessments more readily.*

Corrected in 2024.

*The SSC notes that the ESR process has matured over several decades to effectively use ecosystem trends to inform annual specifications and encourages the use of trans-disciplinary approaches for linking ESR and ESPs to stock assessments in the future. The GOA pollock assessment was suggested as a potential case study, particularly in contrasting differences in the strength of 2018 vs. 2019 year classes.*

A research model is presented in Appendix 1E that explores
incorporating ESP data into the pollock stock assessment. This
model embeds a dynamic structural equation model (DSEM) into the
assessment, and uses complex causal relationships among eight ESP
indicators to explain recruitment variation. Preliminary results
are encouraging, with strong statistical evidence that this
approach can substantially reduce unexplained recruitment
variation and improve short-term projections like those used for
management.
