# Results
## Model selection and evaluation
### Model selection
Prior to identifying a model for consideration, an analysis was
conducted of the impact of each new data element on model
results. Figure 1.\@ref(fig:add-data) shows the changes in
estimated spawning biomass as the updated catch projections,
catch at age, and surveys were added sequentially. Most additions
to the model did not change the trend but did increase the scale
a fairly small amount, but it was consistently in the same
direction, adding up to a nearly 30% larger recent spawning
stock. This is not typically the case, and this year both the
additions of new data and the model updates increased the scale
of spawning biomass (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:mod-compare)). This change
is driven largely by changes in recruits estimated
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:mod-compare2)). Notably the 2012 year class
estimates were impacted by both, presumably with the new age data
suggesting the cohort is still large and the new selectivity on
survey 6 being lower for those older ages. The change is scale is
not particularly surprising given the known sensitivity for this
model (as explored more thoroughly in e.g., @monnahan2021a) and
the Plan Team presentations in 2022 ([link to
pdf](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=7df129bb-16cb-4dba-a4d5-a160c31d087e.pdf&fileName=GOA%20pollock%20model%20updates.pdf)).
The stock trend was stable across data additions and model
changes.

The intent of this year's assessment was to provide a
straightforward update without considering major changes to the
model. We recently explored models that used VAST estimates in
place of area-swept biomass estimates for the NMFS bottom trawl
survey. The VAST estimates did not fit as well as the area-swept
estimates when given similar weighting, and we concluded that
additional model evaluation was needed before using the VAST
estimates. Several other modeling approaches for GOA pollock are
under development, including incorporation of predator
consumption [@barnes2020a] in the assessment model, use of mean
hatch date from the EcoFOFI early larval survey to inform
catchability to the Shelikof Strait survey, and model-based
estimates of Shelikof and summer acoustic indices using VAST. We
selected model 19.1a as the preferred model, and a final turning
step was done using the @francis2011a approach which reweighted
all composition components, including the summer acoustic age
composition for the first time, but model results were similar
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:add-data)).

### Model evaluation
The fit of model 19.1a to age composition data was evaluated
using plots of observed and predicted age composition and
residual plots. Figure 1.\@ref(fig:tv-q) shows the estimates of
time-varying catchability for the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey
and the ADF&G crab/groundfish survey, as well as the constant
catchabilities for the other surveys. The catchability for the
Shelikof Strait acoustic survey continued to decrease away
from 1. Catchability for the NMFS bottom trawl and summer
acoustic surveys were similar (0.81 and 0.76 respectively), while
the age-1 and age-2 Shelikof survey catchabilities were 0.30 and
0.34, respectively, reflecting the fact that the survey does not
target these immature ages. Plots show the fit to fishery age
composition (Figs. 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-fsh),
1.\@ref(fig:pearson-fsh)), Shelikof Strait acoustic survey age
composition
(Figs. 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-srv1),1.\@ref(fig:pearson-srv1)), NMFS
trawl survey age composition
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-pearson-srv2)), and ADF&G trawl survey
age composition (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-pearson-srv3)). Model
fits to fishery age composition data are adequate in most years,
though the very strong 2012 year class shows up as a positive
residual in 2016-2019 due to stronger than expected abundance in
the age composition, while the older ages tended to have negative
residuals. This may indicate that the fishery is targeting on the
2012 year class. The largest residuals tended to be at ages 1-2
in the NMFS bottom trawl survey due to inconsistencies between
the initial estimates of abundance and subsequent information
about year class size. But overall there were no major issues in
fitting the age composition data.

In recent assessments there was apparent conflict and uncertainty
in the data about the size of the 2018 cohort. The new age
composition data for the 2021 fishery, NMFS bottom trawl and
summer acoustic surveys, and 2022 Shelikof survey provide further
information to shed further light on the fate of this cohort. The
fit to the 2022 Shelikof survey age was again negative for age 4
fish, making it the second year in a row with a negative residual
for the 2018 cohort. In contrast the 2021 NMFS bottom trawl
survey and fishery saw large proportions of this cohort and
fitted well. This disparity in the 2018 cohort is discussed more
in the risk table section, but the model estimate for this cohort
did not change much from 2021 (\@ref(tab:timeseries)).

Model fits to survey biomass estimates are reasonably good for
all surveys except the period 2015-2019
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:index-fits)). There are large positive
residuals for the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey in 2017, 2018
and 2019, and strong negative residuals for the NMFS bottom trawl
survey for 2017 and 2019. In addition, the model is unable to fit
the extremely low values for the ADF&G survey in 2015-2017. The
fit to the summer acoustic survey is reasonable even during the
most recent period. The model shows good fits to both the 2021
Shelikof Strait acoustic survey and the 2021 NMFS bottom trawl,
while the 2021 ADF&G bottom trawl and 2021 summer acoustic survey
fits were reasonable. The fit to the age-1 and age-2 Shelikof
acoustic indices was considered acceptable
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:index-fits2)).

## Time series results
Parameter estimates and model output are presented in a series of
tables and figures. Estimated survey and fishery selectivity for
different periods are given in Table 1.\@ref(tab:selex) (see also
Figs. 1.\@ref(fig:fig-selex) and 1.\@ref(fig:selex-tv-fsh). Table
1.\@ref(tab:naa-est) gives the estimated population numbers at
age for the years 1970-`r year`. Table 1.\@ref(tab:timeseries)
gives the estimated time series of age 3+ population biomass,
age-1 recruitment, status, and harvest rate (catch/3+ biomass)
for 1977-`r year` (see also
Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ssb-status-rec). Table 1.\@ref(tab:rec-ssb)
gives coefficients of variation and 95% confidence intervals for
age-1 recruitment and spawning stock biomass. Stock size peaked
in the early 1980s at approximately 113% of the proxy for
unfished stock size (B100% = mean 1978- `r year-1` recruitment
multiplied by the spawning biomass per recruit in the absence of
fishing (SPR@F=0), see below for how this is calculated). In
2002, the stock dropped below the B40% for the first time since
the early 1980s, and reached a minimum in 2003 of 36% of unfished
stock size. Over the years 2009-2013 stock size showed a strong
upward trend, increasing from 46% to 86% of unfished stock size,
but declined to 54% of unfished stock size in 2015. The spawning
stock peaked in 2017 at 90% as the strong 2012 year class
matured, and has declined subsequently to 52% in 2022. Figure
1.\@ref(fig:status) shows the historical pattern of exploitation
of the stock both as a time series of SPR and fishing mortality
compared to the current estimates of biomass and fishing
mortality reference points. Except from the mid-1970s to
mid-1980s fishing mortalities have generally been lower than the
current OFL definition, and in nearly all years were lower than
the FMSY proxy of F35% .

## Comparison of historical assessment results

A comparison of assessment results for the years 1999-`r year`
indicates the current estimated trend in spawning biomass for
1990-`r year` is consistent with previous estimates
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:historical)). All time series show a similar
pattern of decreasing spawning biomass in the 1990s, a period of
greater stability in 2000s, followed by an increase starting
in 2008. The estimated 2021 age composition from the current
assessment were very similar to the projected 2021 age
composition from the 2020 assessment
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:pred-endN)). Generally, the two models agree
except for the age 1 recruits, where the `r year-1` model assumed
average recruitment, but the `r year` has data from the Shelikof
survey which showed a weak year class. This difference does not
strongly affect the OFL and ABC for next year because these fish
are not in the exploitable population.

## Retrospective analysis of base model
A retrospective analysis consists of dropping the data
year-by-year from the current model, and provides an evaluation
of the stability of the current model as new data are
added. Figure 1.\@ref(fig:retros) shows a retrospective plot with
data sequentially removed back to `r year-10`. The range of
errors in the estimates of spawning biomass (if the current
assessment is accepted as truth) is -28% to 17%, but usually the
errors are much smaller (median absolute error is 15%). There is
relatively minor positive retrospective pattern to errors in the
assessment, and the revised Mohnâ€™s $\rho$ [@mohn1999a] across all
ten peels for ending year spawning biomass is -0.081, which does
not indicate a concern with retrospective bias.

## Stock productivity

Recruitment of GOA pollock is more variable (CV = `r CVrec`
over 1978-`r year-1`) than Eastern Bering Sea pollock (CV =
0.60). Other North Pacific groundfish stocks, such as sablefish
and Pacific ocean perch, also have high recruitment
variability. However, unlike sablefish and Pacific ocean perch,
pollock have a short generation time (~8 years), so that large
year classes do not persist in the population long enough to have
a buffering effect on population variability. Because of these
intrinsic population characteristics, the typical pattern of
biomass variability for GOA pollock will be sharp increases due
to strong recruitment, followed by periods of gradual decline
until the next strong year class recruits to the population. GOA
pollock is more likely to show this pattern than other groundfish
stocks in the North Pacific due to the combination of a short
generation time and high recruitment variability.

Since 1980, strong year classes have occurred periodically every
four to six years (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ssb-status-rec)). Because of
high recruitment variability, the mean relationship between
spawning biomass and recruitment is difficult to estimate despite
good contrast in spawning biomass. Strong and weak year classes
have been produced at high and low level of spawning
biomass. Spawner productivity is higher on average at low
spawning biomass compared to high spawning biomass, indicating
that survival of eggs to recruitment is density-dependent
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:spawn-prod)). However, this pattern of
density-dependent survival only emerges on a decadal scale, and
could be confounded with environmental variability on the same
temporal scale. The decadal trends in spawner productivity have
produced the pattern of increase and decline in the GOA pollock
population. The last two decades have been a period of relatively
low spawner productivity, though there appears to be a recent
increase. Age-1 recruitment in 2022 is estimated to be to
be very weak, but the 2021 recruitment is above average, although
these estimates will remain very uncertain until additional data
become available (\@ref(fig:ssb-status-rec)).
