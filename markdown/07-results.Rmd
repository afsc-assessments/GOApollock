# Results
## Model selection and evaluation
### Model selection
Prior to identifying a model for consideration, an analysis was
conducted of the impact of each new data element on model
results. Figure 1.\@ref(fig:add-data) shows the changes in
estimated spawning biomass as the updated catch projections,
catch at age, and surveys were added sequentially. This year,
additions did not change the trend and scale of the stock as in
the last few years.

Four new models were proposed this year, 23a, 23b, 23c, and 23d.
Basic results are presented for the first three, and more
detailed results for 23d which is the authors' recommended model.
Model 23a which updates input sample sizes and biomass CVs had a
minor impact on SSB and uncertainty relative to last year's model
(23) with the 2024 data in it (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ssb-cv-re)).
Model 23b estimated about 15% lower recent SSB, and about 15%
higher SSB from 2000 to 2010, and overall decreased uncertainty.
Dropping the age 1 and 2 indices (23c) had a minor impact and was
very similar to 23b. Model 23d had the largest impact on
estimates, with about a 20% reduction in the CV of SSB, due to
the higher weight given to age composition data when using the
Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ess)).

Unreasonably low estimates of recruitment in recent years went
away starting with model 23c and were similar for model 23d (Fig.
1.\@ref(fig:recruit-compare)).

### Model evaluation

Model 23d had good statistical performance. Convergence was
determined by successful inversion of the Hessian matrix and a
maximum gradient component of less than 1e-4 (this value was
5.88e-8 for Model 23d). A jitter analysis revealed that the
base model and all alternative models are insensitive
to perturbations of parameter start values on the order of 10%
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:jitter)). All parameters were estimated within
their pre-specified bounds. A self-test simulation, where 100
data sets were simulated from the the estimated model and refit
also showed no concerns (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:selftest)). A
likelihood profile over the catchability for the NMFS BT index
serves as a proxy for scale, and shows limited information in the
data sets to set this scale, a known issue with this stock (Fig.
1.\@ref(fig:profile-q2)).

Parameter estimates and uncertainty are given in Table
1.\@ref(tab:parests)). Figure 1.\@ref(fig:tv-q) shows the
estimates of survey catchability, including for the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey which is driven by
an environmental covariate.  Catchability for the NMFS bottom
trawl and summer acoustic surveys were similar
(`r round(finalfit$rep$q2[1],2)` and 
`r round(finalfit$rep$q6,2)`
respectively).

The fit of model 23d to age composition data was evaluated using
plots of observed and predicted age composition (Figs.
1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-fsh), 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-srv1), 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-srv2),
1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-srv3), and 1.\@ref(fig:obs-exp-srv6)).
One-step-ahead (OSA) residuals [@trijoulet2023a] and aggregate
fits are used to assess fits to composition data (Fig.
1.\@ref(fig:osa-all)). Model fits to fishery age composition data
are adequate in most years, though the very strong 2012 year
class shows up as a positive residual in 2016-2023 due to
stronger than expected abundance in the age composition. Previous
assessments had strong patterns of negative residuals for older
ages, but it is clear now using OSA residuals that these were not
real and instead an artifact of Pearson residuals being wrong. In
contrast, the pattern of negative residuals for age 4 and
positive for age 3 persists with OSA residuals, suggesting these
are real. More complicated selectivity forms were able to
eliminate this pattern [Appendix 1F of @monnahan2023a], but these
were not recommended due to their added complexity and minimal
impact on management advice. The NMFS bottom trawl survey has
relatively good residuals, even for the most recent years where
there is a misfit in the index. The ADF&G compositions overall do
not fit well, especially to the age 10 plus group.  The two
acoustic surveys had no apparent issues fitting to the data,
although there are some large values. Overall there were no major
issues in fitting the age composition data and the issues
highlighted here are considered minor.

Model fits to survey biomass estimates are reasonably good for
all surveys except the period 2015-2019 and now in 2023 with poor
fits to the 2023 Shelikof winter acoustic survey and NMFS bottom
trawl surveys (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:index-fits)). The lack of fit in
the NMFS bottom trawl survey from 2015 to 2023 is a major concern
and discussed in the context of the risk table below. In
addition, the model is unable to fit the extremely low values for
the ADF&G survey in 2015-2017. The fit to the summer acoustic
survey is reasonable even during the most recent period. The
model shows good fits to both the 2021 Shelikof Strait acoustic
survey and the 2021 NMFS bottom trawl, while the 2021 ADF&G
bottom trawl and 2021 summer acoustic survey fits were
reasonable. 

## Time series results
Parameter estimates and model output are presented in a series of
tables and figures. Estimated survey and fishery selectivity for
different periods are given in Table 1.\@ref(tab:selex) (see also
Figs. 1.\@ref(fig:fig-selex) and 1.\@ref(fig:selex-tv-fsh). Table
1.\@ref(tab:naa-est) gives the estimated population numbers at
age for the years 1970-`r year`. Table 1.\@ref(tab:timeseries)
gives the estimated time series of age 3+ population biomass,
age-1 recruitment, status, and harvest rate (catch/3+ biomass)
for 1977-`r year` (see also
Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ssb-status-rec)). Table 1.\@ref(tab:rec-ssb)
gives coefficients of variation and 95% confidence intervals for
age-1 recruitment and spawning stock biomass.

Stock size peaked in the early 1980s at approximately 103% of the
proxy for unfished stock size (B100% = mean 1978- `r year-1`
recruitment multiplied by the spawning biomass per recruit in the
absence of fishing (SPR at F=0), see below for how this is
calculated). In 2002, the stock dropped below B40% for the first
time since the early 1980s, and reached a minimum in 2003 of 35%
of unfished stock size. Over the years 2009-2013 stock size
showed a strong upward trend, increasing from 49% to 83% of
unfished stock size, but declined to 60% of unfished stock size
in 2015. The spawning stock peaked in 2017 at 86% as the strong
2012 year class matured, and has declined subsequently to 56%
in 2024. Figure 1.\@ref(fig:status) shows the historical pattern
of exploitation of the stock both as a time series of SPR and
fishing mortality compared to the current estimates of biomass
and fishing mortality reference points. Except from the mid-1970s
to mid-1980s fishing mortalities have generally been lower than
the current OFL definition, and in nearly all years were lower
than the FMSY proxy of F35%.

## Retrospective analysis of base model
A retrospective analysis consists of dropping the data
year-by-year from the current model, and provides an evaluation
of the stability of the current model as new data are added.
Figure 1.\@ref(fig:retros) shows a retrospective plot with data
sequentially removed back to `r year-7`. The range of errors in
the estimates of spawning biomass (if the current assessment is
accepted as truth) is -32.1% to 2.3%, but usually the errors are
much smaller (median absolute error is 16%). There was a
relatively large negative retrospective pattern in the assessment
in recent years (i.e., the model consistently underestimates
SSB). The revised Mohnâ€™s $\rho$ [@mohn1999a] across all ten peels
for terminal spawning biomass is -0.159. This is not considered a
significant $\rho$ based on a bootstrapping analysis done in the
2022 assessment which found that by chance $\rho$ would be
between -0.21 and 0.29 (Bryan and Monnahan in prep), and is smaller
than in recent years. Retrospective behavior of fishing mortality
(F) and recruitment are also shown in Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:retros)
but not discussed here. Trends in estimates of cohort sizes is
also given in Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:retro-recruits), which are more
stable compared to previous years due to the age 1 and 2 Shelikof
indices being removed. The 2020 and 2021 cohorts are both
estimated as smaller than originally thought.

## Comparison of historical assessment results

A comparison of assessment results for the years 1999-`r year`
indicates the current estimated trend in spawning biomass for
1990-`r year` is consistent with previous estimates (Table
1.\@ref(tab:model-history) and Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:historical)). All
time series show a similar pattern of decreasing spawning biomass
in the 1990s, a period of greater stability in 2000s, followed by
an increase starting in 2008. The estimated `r year` age
composition from the current assessment was very similar to the
projected `r year` age composition from the `r year-1` assessment
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:pred-endN)). Generally, the two models agree
except for the age 1 recruits, where the `r year-1` model assumed
average recruitment, but the `r year` model has data from the
Shelikof survey which showed a weak 2022 year class. This difference
does not strongly affect the OFL and ABC for next year because
these fish are not in the exploitable population.

## Stock productivity

Recruitment of GOA pollock is more variable (CV = `r CVrec`
over 1978-`r year-1`) than Eastern Bering Sea pollock (CV =
0.60). Other North Pacific groundfish stocks, such as sablefish
and Pacific ocean perch, also have high recruitment
variability. However, unlike sablefish and Pacific ocean perch,
pollock have a short generation time (~8 years), so that large
year classes do not persist in the population long enough to have
a buffering effect on population variability. Because of these
intrinsic population characteristics, the typical pattern of
biomass variability for GOA pollock will be sharp increases due
to strong recruitment, followed by periods of gradual decline
until the next strong year class recruits to the population. GOA
pollock is more likely to show this pattern than other groundfish
stocks in the North Pacific due to the combination of a short
generation time and high recruitment variability.

Since 1980, strong year classes have occurred periodically every
four to six years (Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:ssb-status-rec)). Because of
high recruitment variability, the mean relationship between
spawning biomass and recruitment is difficult to estimate despite
good contrast in spawning biomass. Strong and weak year classes
have been produced at high and low level of spawning
biomass. Spawner productivity is higher on average at low
spawning biomass compared to high spawning biomass, indicating
that survival of eggs to recruitment is density-dependent
(Fig. 1.\@ref(fig:spawn-prod)). However, this pattern of
density-dependent survival only emerges on a decadal scale, and
could be confounded with environmental variability on the same
temporal scale. The decadal trends in spawner productivity have
produced the pattern of increase and decline in the GOA pollock
population. The last two decades have been a period of relatively
low spawner productivity, though there appears to be a recent
increase.
