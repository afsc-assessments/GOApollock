## Area Allocation of Harvest

The following table shows the recommended ABC apportionment for
`r year+1` and `r year +2`. Please refer to Appendix 1D for
information regarding how apportionment is calculated. Area 640
is not portioned by season. Total ABC by area may differ slightly
from season sums due to rounding.


```{r}

tab <- read_xlsx(table.path, skip=1,sheet='apportionment') %>%
  dplyr::select(1:4) %>% setNames(letters[1:4])
tab$f=rowSums(round(tab[,3:4],0), na.rm=TRUE) # rounding so totals match up across rows, per A. Jahn's advice
flextable(tab[,]) %>%
  set_header_labels(values=list(a="Year", b="Area", c="Season A\nABC (t)", d="Season B\nABC (t)", f='Total\nABC (t)')) %>%
  colformat_double(digits=0, big.mark=',', j=2:5) %>%
  colformat_double(digits=0, big.mark='',j=1) %>%
  merge_h_range(i=c(4,8),j1=3, j2=4) %>% align(i=c(4,8), j=3, align = 'center') %>%
  hline(i=4)
```
